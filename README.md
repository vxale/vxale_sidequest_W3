## Project Title

Side Quest Week 3: Long Way Home at Midnight - An Interactive Game

---

## Description

Long Way Home at Midnight is a short, choice-driven interactive story built in p5.js using multiple game states. The player navigates a late-night commute by clicking buttons or using keyboard shortcuts to make decisions that branch the story into three different endings. The project is inspired by everyday moral situations in urban life and explores how small choices can lead to different consequences.
